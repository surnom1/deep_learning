Repository with deep_learning courses
SimpleANN.ipynb: creates a perceptron from scratch and a MLPclassifier for MNIST
simple_cnn.ipynb:simple convolution example, max_pooling example, CNN with keras for mnist with plot and loss/accuracy
TP1: creates a linear regression with SGD from scratch
TP2: creates a linear regression model with sklearn
TP3: generates lots and lots of noise(95 useless variables and 5 useful ones) and then filter out the bad ones using LassoCV
